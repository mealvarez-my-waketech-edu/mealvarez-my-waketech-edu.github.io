# **About Me**  
Hi, my name is **Mark Alvarez** and This is my school account and this repository will hold assignments. I am currently a student who is pursuing a degree in business analytics at Wake Technical Community College. This class is the first I have taken in web design and I am finding this challenging but interesting. In times like these I try to remember this quote:  
> We are what we repeatedly do, therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit

### **My Interests**
The things I enjoy most are:  
 * Playing video games
 * Cooking
 * Gardening
 * Photography
 * Sewing
 * Walking my dog

 Additionally, we have been trying to connect more with our neighborhood lately, and have been going to community events so we can meet new people.
