# **About Me**  
Hi, my name is **Mark Alvarez** and This is my school account and this repository will hold assignments. I am currently a student who is pursuing a degree in business analytics at Wake Technical Community College. This class is the first I have taken in web design and I am finding this challenging but interesting. In times like these I try to remember this quote:  
> We are what we repeatedly do, therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit - **_Aristotle_**

#### Here is a _large_ image of Aristotle because I didnt know how to make it smaller!

### **My Interests**
The things I enjoy most are:  
 * Playing video games
 * Cooking

 * Sewing
 * Walking my dog

 Additionally, we have been trying to connect more with our neighborhood lately, and have been going to community events so we can meet new people.

### **Websites I Recommend**
1. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I enjoy using this website to find tutorials for games I am playing and also to find education videos that can help me understand new concepts both in school and at work!
2. [Blackboard ASSIST](https://blackboard.waketech.edu/ultra/integration/bbAssist) - I reccomend this website to all students enrolled at Wake Tech! There are many resources here that can be utilized to make your semester a successful one!
