# **About Me**  
Hi, my name is **Mark Alvarez** and I am currently a student who is pursuing a degree in business analytics at Wake Technical Community College. This class is the first I have taken in web design and I am finding this challenging but interesting. This is my school account and this repository will hold assignments.
