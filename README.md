# **About Me**  
Hi, my name is **Mark Alvarez** and I am currently a student who is pursuing a degree in business analytics at Wake Technical Community College. This class is the first I have taken in web design and I am finding this challenging but interesting. This is my school account and this repository will hold assignments.

### **My Interests**
The things I enjoy most are:  
 * Playing video games
 * Cooking
 * Gardening
 * Photography
 * Sewing
 * Walking my dog

 Additionally, we have been trying to connect more with our neighborhood lately, and have been going to community events so we can meet new people.
